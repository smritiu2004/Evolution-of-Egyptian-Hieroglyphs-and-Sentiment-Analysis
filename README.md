# Sentiment Analysis of Ancient Egyptian Texts (Seed Project)

## Overview
This repository contains an early-stage research project exploring whether sentiment analysis techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be applied to Latin transliterations of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic texts. The project investigates how emotional expression may vary across historical periods and text types, and examines the challenges of applying modern NLP methods to low-resource, historical language data.

The work is intended as a seed project for interdisciplinary research at the intersection of NLP, historical linguistics, and data science.

## Research Questions
- Can basic sentiment categories (positive, neutral, negative) be detected in transliterations of ancient Egyptian texts using standard NLP techniques?
- How does the emotional tone of texts vary across major historical periods?
- Are patterns of sentiment associated with different text types (e.g. religious vs. administrative texts)?

## Current Approach
- Text preprocessing and sentiment classification using NLTK
- Experiments conducted on English translations and Latin transliterations
- Exploratory analysis focused on feasibility rather than performance optimisation

## Project Status
This is an early-stage, exploratory project. The repository contains initial code, research notes, and coursework-based experiments that document the origin of the idea and its first implementations.

## Future Directions
- Re-implementing the pipeline using CLTK for better linguistic handling of transliterations
- Expanding datasets with expert-curated texts
- Exploring OCR-based approaches for direct glyph analysis
- Collaborating with researchers in Egyptology, linguistics, and NLP

## Notes
Detailed background, reflections, and original coursework materials are available in `PROJECT_NOTES.md`.

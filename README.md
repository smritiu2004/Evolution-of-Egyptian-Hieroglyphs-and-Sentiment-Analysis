# Evolution-of-Egyptian-Hieroglyphs-and-Sentiment-Analysis
- Conducting research on how evolution of Egyptian Hieroglyphs could affect the way sentiments are expressed
- Emphasis on the importance of human language evolution when training AI models. 

## Abstract 

This study was conducted as part of the COMP2121 Data Mining module.

The beginning of language came from the need to express sentiments. As time evolved, so did the way of expression. There is one thing about expressing yourself through language—and another where the language itself becomes the expression. Ancient scripts that relied on visual and symbolic forms captured this idea powerfully. Egyptian hieroglyphs, in particular, conveyed not just actions but layered meanings tied to belief, identity, and ritual. From the Old Kingdom’s pictorial glyphs to the more abstract forms of later dynasties, the system evolved in both structure and symbolic meaning.

For this pilot study, a small dataset of hieroglyphic transliterations was created with the help of large language models, and cross-checked using available online resources. Basic NLP techniques using Python’s NLTK library, along with simple classification methods in Weka, were used to explore how sentiment may have been expressed across different dynasties and literary forms. Tools like ChatGPT supported initial tagging and interpretation, while manual reviews ensured contextual alignment. Early observations suggest shifts in emotional tone—from declarative or ritualistic 
expressions in early dynasties to more narrative and symbolic uses in later texts.

By studying the evolution of hieroglyphic expression through a sentiment analysis lens, this research highlights the connection between language structure and emotional communication. It also draws attention to the need for sentiment-aware training of modern large language models (LLMs) on linguistically and culturally diverse data. As modes of expression continue to evolve—even in present-day communication—LLMs must be able to recognize, interpret, and adapt to shifting patterns in how sentiment is conveyed. Insights from ancient, symbol-based languages like hieroglyphs offer a valuable perspective on this evolution, helping shape more nuanced and context-aware models for the future.


## Notes on the Dataset 

- The dataset was made with the help of ChatGPT. I prompted it to produce a dataset consisting of key text which showed sentiments from different dynasties. 
- I later used the Reasoning feature to check if the transliterations were close to correctdness to the texts it provided. 
- The dataset may not be accurate! I am no expert in the Ancient Egyptian language. The transliteraions provided are purely AI's (aka ChatGPT in this case). 
- I made some attempts to find transliterations and their corresponding English texts - but access to such documents were limited due to a requirement for subscriptions, or some of it was not accessible at all even after a lot of searching for databases. 
- Any recommended rectifications to the existing dataset is truly appreciated :)

- Emphasis on the importance of human language evolution when training AI models. 

## Abstract 



## Notes on the Dataset 

- The dataset was made with the help of ChatGPT. I prompted it to produce a dataset consisting of key text which showed sentiments from different dynasties. 
- I later used the Reasoning feature to check if the transliterations were close to correctdness to the texts it provided. 
- The dataset may not be accurate! I am no expert in the Ancient Egyptian language. The transliteraions provided are purely AI's (aka ChatGPT in this case). 
- I made some attempts to find transliterations and their corresponding English texts - but access to such documents were limited due to a requirement for subscriptions, or some of it was not accessible at all even after a lot of searching for databases. 
- Any recommended rectifications to the existing dataset is truly appreciated :)
